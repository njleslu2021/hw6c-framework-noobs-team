# Anonymous team

Team anonymous has a good intention to help with us understanding their code, writing new plugins and debugging with something like technical issue faced with node.js or pom.xml setup. 

When we submit a git issue on their repo, they are replying to those issues very quickly and thoroughly. Also they will organize the frequenctly asked questions into documents and added it into the readme files.

We had a great time working with them and team anonymous did provided us a great quality of technical support. We appreciate that!
