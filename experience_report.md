# Anonymous team

Team anonymous has a good intention to help with us understanding their code, writing new plugins and debugging with something like technical issue faced with node.js or pom.xml setup. 

When we submit a git issue on their repo, they are replying to those issues very quickly and thoroughly. Also they will organize the frequenctly asked questions into documents and added it into the README files, though the README was already well documented with instructions and suggestions.

The only thing I think can be improved is that the sample plugins can give more in-line comments showing how the library was used. 

Overall, We had a great time working with them and team anonymous did provided us a great quality of technical support. We appreciate that!
